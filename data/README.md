# Data Files Directory

Place your Excel data files in this directory:

## Required Files:
- `P.xlsx` - Projects master data
- `PT.xlsx` - Project transactions (actuals)
- `AE.xlsx` - Activities estimates (budget)
- `Program_Management.xlsm` - Program management data

## File Paths:
The application will look for files in this directory by default. You can change the file paths in the Settings tab if your files are located elsewhere.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility:
- **Windows**: Files can be placed in `C:\path\to\project\data\`
- **macOS**: Files can be placed in `/path/to/project/data/`
- **Linux**: Files can be placed in `/path/to/project/data/`

## Alternative Locations:
If you prefer to keep files elsewhere, update the paths in:
Settings Tab â†’ Data File Paths

The application will remember your custom paths.
